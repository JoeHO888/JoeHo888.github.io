In the past, I thought I mastered some new technologies, knowledge after watching a bunch of videos and reading articles until I found that I still didn't know how to apply these skills in a real challenge. After that, I started doing different kinds of projects, either for fun or for learning purpose.

Below are projects I have worked on and well-documented.

#### Attempt To Solve Geetest CAPTCHA
CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) is widely adopted in various websites to protect them against bots. Geetest is a China company specializing in CAPTCHA Research and Development, it serves numerous multinational corporations, e.g Nike, Xiaomi. 

I attempted to crack their CAPTCHAs on Geetest website with several techniques, including image processing and selenium automation. I summarised how I approach this problem, how I integrate different skills together to solve this problem in below write-up.
